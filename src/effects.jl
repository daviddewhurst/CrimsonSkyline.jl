    function replay(f :: F, t :: Trace) where F <: Function

Given a stochastic function `f` and a trace `t`, makes `sample` calls behave as though 
they had sampled the values in `t` at the corresponding addresses. 

Returns a tuple `(t_new, g)`, where `t_new` is a trace and `g` is a function.
The function signature of `g` is the same as that of `f` with the first argument removed; that
is, if `f(t :: Trace, params...)`, then `g(params...)`. Computation is delayed, so each of the
latent nodes in `t_new` has `interpretation = REPLAYED`.
Calling `g(params...)` executes the computation and each latent node in `t_new` reverts to 
its original interpretation.

Given a mapping `r` from addresses to distribution-like (currently `Distributions`

with this set of distributions. Returns a function `g` that has return signature 
`(t :: Trace, rval)` where `rval` is a return value of `f`.

corresponding distributions in the values of `r`. Returns a function with 
call signature `g(params...)` that returns `(t :: Trace, rval)`, where `rval`

Given a stochastic function `f`, a trace `t`, and an iterable of addresses, converts traced

The function signature of `g` is the same as that of `f` with the first argument removed; that
is, if `f(t :: Trace, params...)`, then `g(params...)`. Computation is delayed, so each of

**EXPERIMENTAL**: Given a stochastic function `f` and a `SamplingResults` `r`, update the prior

posterior. Returns a stochastic function `g` with the same call signature as `f`. This function will modify in
